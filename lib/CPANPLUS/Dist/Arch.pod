=head1 NAME

CPANPLUS::Dist::Arch - CPANPLUS backend for building Archlinux pacman packages

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  (First, setup cpan to use us automatically)
  $ setupdistarch

  (Install the module as a pacman package)
  $ cpanp -i Perl::Module::Here

  (Use cpan2dist to make a package, but don't install it)
  $ cpan2dist Acme::Bleach

  (Use our included cpan2aur to make a source package in current dir)
  $ cpan2aur CPANPLUS::Dist::Arch

  (In case we need to customize our package build, create a directory
   with a template we can use for future versions.)
  $ cpan2aur -d CPANPLUS::Dist::Arch
  ==> Creating new directory for CPANPLUS::Dist::Arch...
    -> Looking up module for CPANPLUS::Dist::Arch on CPAN...
  Running [/usr/bin/perl /usr/bin/perlbin/core/cpanp-run-perl /home/juster/.cpanplus/5.10.1/build/CPANPLUS-Dist-Arch-0.16/Makefile.PL INSTALLDIRS=site]...
  Writing Makefile for CPANPLUS::Dist::Arch
    -> Creating new PKGBUILD.tt template file...
  ==> Created perl-cpanplus-dist-arch source package directory.

  (Customize the template... add a optdepends, library depends, etc.
   Just leave the rest of it alone.)
  $ cd perl-cpanplus-dist-arch
  $ ed PKGBUILD.tt

  (Submit it to AUR!  Will ask for a login username/password or remember
   the last one used)
  $ cpan2aur -u

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is used as a plugin of CPANPLUS to transparently package
CPAN distribution files into pacman packages as they are installed.
This module can also be used by programmers to build packages in more
complex ways.  For example, it can create source packages for the AUR
by using the included L<cpan2aur> program.

=head1 REQUIREMENTS

You will need to have pacman installed, of course, to create package
and to install these new packages.  Pacman is included with Archlinux
but can even be used on other Linux distributions.
(see http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman)

=head1 SETUP

Type L<setupdistarch> at the command line to install CPAN modules
as packages by default.

=head1 WHERE IS THE PACKAGE

By default, packages are stored under the user's home directory in the
I<.cpanplus> directory.  Two seperate directories are created for
building packages and for storing the resulting package file.

I<5.10.1> represents the version of perl you used to build the package
and I<~/.cpanplus> represents the base directory chosen in your CPANPLUS
config.

=over 4

=item * Build Directory: C<~/.cpanplus/5.10.1/pacman/build>

=item * Package Directory: C<~/.cpanplus/5.10.1/pacman/pkg>

=back

=head1 CUSTOMIZATION

You can change defaults settings machine-wide (for every user) or for
one user or package.  The machine-wide settings are set in the
I</etc/makepkg.conf> file.  The user/package customizations are set
using environment variables.

=over

=item B<PKGDEST>

Override where the package files end up.

=item B<PACKAGER>

Override the Contributor comment line at the top of the PKGBUILD.

=back

=for readme stop

=head2 EXAMPLE

Here is how you can use environment variables to put the package files
in our I<~/pkgs> directory for the L<ALPM> module. (along with any
modules we have to build and install to create it)

  PACKAGER='Juster <juster at cpan dot org>' PKGDEST=~/pkgs cpanp -i ALPM

=head1 COMMAND LINE OPTIONS

There are many command line options to L<cpan2dist> and L<cpanp>.  A
small number of these options are recognized by CPANPLUS::Dist::Arch.

=over

=item B<--verbose> I<(DISABLED)>

We are now verbose by default!  Hope this is okay.

=item B<--skiptest>

This will pass the --nocheck option to makepkg. Automated tests
that the module author has written for your benefit will be avoided
when building a package for the module.

  WARNING: This affects all pre-requisite module/packages that are
           built and installed; not just the module you specify.

=back

=head1 DIST OPTIONS

cpan2dist allows you specify CPANPLUS::Dist::Arch specific options on
the command line using the I<--dist-opts> switch.  You can also pass
these arguments when using CPANPLUS::Module methods like dist().

=over

=item B<pkgtype>

This specifies whether to make a source package or a binary package.
The default is to make a binary package.

=item B<destdir>

This overrides every other package destination specified.  Whether from
the makepkg.conf file, environment variable, or default.

=item B<quiet>

If set to a true value, pipe makepkg output to /dev/null.

=item B<nocolor>

If set to a true value, disable colorized output from makepkg.  Use monochrome
output only.

=back

=head1 PROGRAMMERS API

The rest of the document describes how a programmer can use the module.
You can use this module with the CPANPLUS module in order to install
distributions/packages in more complex ways.

Here is a quick example of how you use C::D::A with L<CPANPLUS::Backend>.

=head2 EXAMPLE

  use CPANPLUS::Backend;
  use warnings;
  use strict;

  # Create a source package in our current directory, no verbosity.
  my $cb  = CPANPLUS::Backend->new();
  my $mod = $cb->module_tree( 'ALPM' );
  $mod->install( target  => 'create',
                 format  => 'CPANPLUS::Dist::Arch',
                 pkg     => 'src',
                 destdir => '.',
                 verbose => 0
               );

See also L<CPANPLUS::Module>.  The C<create_dist_arch> sub in the
L<cpan2aur> script shows how to use CPANPLUS::Module's dist() method,
which is a little funky.  I<(I want to submit a patch to it when I get
the chance)>

=head2 EXPORT TAGS

=over 4

=item B<:all>

This will import the functions C<dist_pkgname> and C<dist_pkgver> into
your package.  These functions are not imported by default.

=back

=head2 EXPORTED FUNCTIONS

=head3 dist_pkgname

  Usage   : my $pkgname = dist_pkgname( 'Acme-Drunk' );
  Purpose : Converts a module's distribution name to an
            Archlinux style perl package name.
  Params  : $dist_name - The name of the distribution (ex: Acme-Drunk)
  Returns : The Archlinux perl package name (ex: perl-acme-drunk).
            following the Archlinux packaging standards.

=head3 dist_pkgver

  Usage   : my $pkgver = dist_pkgver( '1.20.1_2A' );
  Purpose : Convert a module's CPAN distribution version into our more
            restrictive pacman package version number.
  Params  : The version of the CPAN distribution file.
  Returns : The Archlinux package version following the Archlinux
            packaging standards.

=head2 PUBLIC METHODS

When using the CPANPLUS module in a perl script to create packages,
these public methods are available.  See the cpanpkgbuild.pl script
included in the examples directory for an example.

=head3 get_pkgname

  Usage   : say $dist->get_pkgname;
  Returns : The name of the package.

=head3 get_pkgver

  Usage   : say $dist->get_pkgver;
  Returns : The version of the package.

=head3 get_pkgrel

  Usage   : say "Release: ", $dist->get_pkgrel;
  Notes   : Default is 1, unless set_pkgrel is used.
  Returns : The package release number.

=head3 set_pkgrel

  Usage   : $newrel = $dist->set_pkgrel( 2 );
  Params  : $new_relnum - Croaks if this is not a number.
  Returns : The new release number.

=head3 set_destdir

  Usage   : $dist->set_destdir('~/pkg/perl');
  Purpose : Overrides the directory to store the built package
            for this particular object.
  Returns : The directory that was set.

=head3 get_destdir

  Usage   : my $dest = $dist->get_destdir;
  Returns : The directory previously specified by set_destdir.

=head3 get_pkgpath

  Usage   : my $fqp = $dist->get_pkgpath;
  Returns : The fully qualified path of the built package
            or undef if no package was built yet.

=head3 get_cpandistdir

  Usage   : my $distdir = $dist->get_cpandistdir;
  Returns : The main directory name that will be inside the distribution
            tarball.  This directory contains the entire distribution.
  Example : If the distribution file of Acme-Bleach is in the tarball
            Acme-Bleach-1.12.tar.gz or Acme-Bleach-1.12.tar.bz2
            then $dist->get_cpandistdir will return 'Acme-Bleach-1.12'.
  Notes   : Does not actually check if the directory exists in the tarball.
            So far it always has...

=head3 get_pkgvars

  Usage   : my %pkgvars = $dist->get_pkgvars;
  Returns : A hash containing all the PKGBUILD variables.
            Keys are the bash variable names in the PKGBUILD.
            Dependencies are converted to their pacman names.
  Notes   : The keys are: pkgname, pkgver, pkgdesc, depends, url, source
            md5sums, arch, pkgrels, and sha512sums if Digest::SHA is
            installed.
 
            One key not named after a PKGBUILD field is 'pkglinks' whose
            value is a hashref. If depends, makedepends, checkdepends,
            or conflicts are present then they will have a key with the
            same name in 'pkglinks'. The value of each key is an arrayref
            of specifications, where each specification is an arrayref of
            package name, a comparison operator, and a version number.

=head3 get_pkgvars_ref

  Usage    : my $pkgvars_ref = $dist->get_pkgvars_ref;
  Returns  : The same as get_pkgvars except as a hashref.

=head3 get_pkgbuild

  Usage    : my $pkgbuildtext = $dist->get_pkgbuild;
  Returns  : A scalar containing the full text of the PKGBUILD that would
             be generated in the perl pacman package.

=head3 create_pkgbuild

  Usage   : $self->create_pkgbuild( '/tmp', 1 );
  Purpose : Creates a PKGBUILD file in the specified directory.
  Params  : $destdir - The directory to put the new PKGBUILD in.
  Precond : You must first call prepare or have CPANPLUS do it automatically.
  Throws  : unknown installer type: '...'
            failed to write PKGBUILD: ...
            Invalid arguments to create_pkgbuild
            Invalid directoy passed to create_pkgbuild: ...
  Returns : Nothing.

=head2 TEMPLATE METHODS

=head3 get_pkgbuild_templ

  Usage   : my $tt_text = $self->get_pkgbuild_templ();
  Purpose : Mostly just to compliment L</set_pkgbuild_templ>.
  Returns : The template used internally by L</get_pkgbuild>

See L</PKGBUILD TEMPLATE>.

=head3 set_pkgbuild_templ

  Usage   : my $new_tt_text = $self->set_pkgbuild_templ( $templ_text );
  Purpose : Create PKGBUILDs based on a custom template.
  Params  : $templ_text - New template text to use for creating the PKGBUILD.
  Returns : The new template text.

See L</PKGBUILD TEMPLATE>.

=head3 set_tt_init_args

  Usage   : $self->set_tt_init_args( INCLUDE_PATH => '/home/juster/aur/tt',
                                     EVAL_PERL    => 1 );
  Purpose : Change arguments that are given to the template module's
            constructor when we create an object to process templates.
  Params  : %init_args - A hash of config key/value pairs.
  Returns : A hash reference to %init_args.

What config value are supported depends on what template module is
being used.  You'll have to look at the module's docs to be sure.

=head3 set_tt_module

  Usage   : $obj->set_tt_module( 0 );
  Params  : $modname - The name of a template module to use or
                       0 to force using the internal engine.
  Warning : This sets the template module to use for ALL
            CPANPLUS::Dist::Arch objects.
  Returns : $modname

=head3 get_tt_module

  Usage   : my $modname = $obj->get_tt_module();
            my $modname = CPANPLUS::Dist::Arch->get_tt_module();
  Returns : The name of the template module that is being used or 0
            if we are using our own internal template engine.

=head2 PKGBUILD TEMPLATE

Since version 0.19 we now use template modules if they are available.
So if any of the following modules are installed and can be used,
they will be used instead of our builtin template engine:

=over

=item 1. L<Template::Toolkit>

=item 2. L<Template::Alloy>

=item 3. L<Template::Tiny>

=back

The modules have the priority listed above.  We go through the list
sequentially and use the first module that we find.

=head3 BUILTIN TEMPLATE FORMAT

The builtin template format is an extremely simplified ripoff of
L<Template::Toolkit> syntax.  It only implements variable
interpolation and the C<IF> directive.  To insert a template variable
use the syntax C<[% foo %]>.  This will insert the value of the
variable named 'foo'.  The C<get_pkgbuild()> method will croak with
the message I<"Template variable ... was not provided"> if the
variable was not defined.  C<[% IF var_name %] ... [% END %]> will
remove what is in-between the C<IF> and C<END> tags if the variable
named C<var_name> is not set to a true value.

Trailing newlines will also be stripped if you use the C<-%]> syntax
(notice the C<->) to close the L<Template::Toolkit> style blocks.

See L</get_pkgvars> for a list of the variables that can be used
inside the template.

=head1 LIMITATIONS

There are some limitations in the way CPANPLUS and pacman works
together that I am not sure can be fixed automatically.  Instead you
might need a human to intervene.  I called these limitations because
they aren't exactly bugs.  More specific bugs with exact error messages
are in the L</BUGS> section.

=over 4

=item B<Cannot detect non-perl dependencies>

As of version 0.09, CPANPLUS will I<try> to find non-perl dependencies.
This only works with ExtUtils::MakeMaker distributions.

This means if you plan on distributing a perl module package (ie
uploading to AUR) you should edit the PKGBUILD by hand to include
the libraries needed by the XS module.

The included L<cpan2aur> script helps creating customized AUR
packages.

=item B<A module is installed, but pacman says it isn't>

CPAN[PLUS] considers a module installed if it can C<use> it.  That
is, if it is in C<@INC> somewhere on your system.

I<Pacman> considers a module installed if it has been packaged and
installed with I<pacman>.

So if you installed some modules in the past without packaging them
first, they don't exist as far as I<pacman> is concerned.  Usually, you
can just reinstall them using this module because CPANPLUS::Dist::Arch
installs modules under the C<vendor_perl/> directories, such as
C</usr/share/perl5/vendor_perl/...>, and CPAN installs under the
C<site_perl/> directories, such as C</usr/share/perl5/site_perl/...>.

Installing with this module will appease I<pacman>, but you may want
to manually delete the previously installed modules to prevent
version mismatch problems.

=item B<Pre-requisites are always installed>

CPANPLUS by default installs the pre-requisite modules before the
module you requested.  This module does the same only it creates an
Arch package and installs it with I<pacman> instead.

You should be able to run I<pacman> under sudo for this to work properly.
Or you could run cpan2dist as root, but I wouldn't recommend it.

=item B<Readline is broken and I can't use cpanplus!>

I had this problem recently.  A system upgrade had updated my readline
package but the L<Term::ReadLine::Gnu> module was not updated.  Or
perhaps I had the termcap-compat package, which breaks
L<Term::ReadLine::Gnu>.

I forget, in any case Term::ReadLine::Gnu was broken.  To be able to
update the perl-term-readline-gnu package, I had to force the
Term::ReadLine module to not try to load Term::ReadLine::Gnu with the
PERL_RL environment variable:

  PERL_RL=0 cpanp -i Term::ReadLine::Gnu

=item B<Dist creation of '...' skipped, build time exceeded: 300 seconds>

If compiling a module takes a long time, this message will pop up.
Interestingly, though, the module keeps compiling in the background...?

This is something CPANPLUS does automatically.  If you had been trying
to install the module, the install step will be aborted.  The package
will still be created in the usual directory, so you can install it
manually.

I haven't been able to track this down yet... I think it has only happened
with cpan2dist so far.  It happened when building L<PDL>, by the way.

To check why the build process failed, read the build logs CPANPLUS
keeps in C<~/.cpanplus/install_logs/>.  The problem may be specific to
the module you're building and not this module.

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

This module was inspired by the perl-cpanplus-pacman package and
CPANPLUS::Dist::Pacman by Firmicus which is available at
L<http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=5954>.

This mostly started from CPANPLUS::Dist::RPM which is on Google Code
at L<http://code.google.com/p/cpanplus-dist-rpm/>.  This was a very
helpful starting point to try to understand the internals of CPANPLUS.
