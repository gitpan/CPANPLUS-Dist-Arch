=head1 NAME

B<CPANPLUS::Dist::Arch> - CPANPLUS backend for building Archlinux pacman packages

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.10

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  $ setupdistarch
  This script will now setup CPANPLUS to automatically package all
  modules into pacman packages when installing.
  Are you sure you want to do this? [y/N] y
  Set CPANPLUS to package all modules through CPANPLUS::Dist::Arch
  $ cpanp -i Perl::Module::Here

  ...Installs the module's distribution file (think package in CPAN lingo)
     as a pacman package...

  Add --verbose for more output:
  $ cpanp -i Acme::Bleach --verbose

  Use cpan2dist to make a package, but don't install it:
  $ cpan2dist --verbose Acme::Bleach

  Now, use special options to create a source package in current directory:
  $ cpan2dist --dist-opts pkgtype=src --dist-opts destdir=. Acme::Bleach

=head1 SETUP

See L<setupdistarch>(1) for more information about setupdistarch.  If
you are having trouble running C<setupdistarch> or C<cpan>, your PATH
may not be set properly, add /usr/bin/perlbin/core and
/use/bin/perlbin/vendor to your .profile file in your home directory.

  # Example ~/.profile
  export PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/bin/perlbin/core:/usr/bin/perlbin/vendor

=head1 WHERE IS THE PACKAGE

By default, packages are stored under the user's home directory in the
.cpanplus directory.  Two seperate directories are created for
building packages and for storing the resulting package file.

=over

=item Build Directory

C<~/.cpanplus/5.10.0/pacman/build>

=item Package Directory

C<~/.cpanplus/5.10.0/pacman/pkg>

=back

Where 5.10.0 represents the version of perl you used to build the
package and ~/.cpanplus represents the base directory chosen
in your CPANPLUS config.

You can change the destination by setting PKGDEST in your
C</etc/makepkg.conf> file.  The PACKAGER in C</etc/makepkg.conf> is
inserted into the PKGBUILD comment header.  If there is no PACKAGER
set, then 'Anonymous' is used instead.

=head1 COMMAND LINE OPTIONS

There are many command line options to L<cpan2dist> and L<cpanp>.  A
small number of these options are recognized by CPANPLUS::Dist::Arch.

=over

=item B<--verbose>

This classic option allows for more verbose messages.  Otherwise you
get next to no output.  Useful for debugging and neurosis.

=item B<--skiptest>

This will I<comment out> the tests in PKGBUILD files that are generated.
I actually think testing is a good idea and would not recommend this
unless you know what you are doing.

  WARNING: This affects all pre-requisite module/packages that are
           built and installed; not just the module you specify.

=back

=head1 DIST OPTIONS

cpan2dist allows you specify CPANPLUS::Dist::Arch specific options on
the command line.  I'm not sure how or if cpanp does the same.  Look
at the source code of the L<cpan2aur> script to see how they also work
programmatically.

=over

=item B<pkgtype>

This specifies whether to make a source package or a binary package.
The default is to make a binary package.

=item B<destdir>

Specifies where to store the resulting package.  The default is to
store under the C<~/.cpanp/pacman/pkg> directory, or the directory
specified by C<PKGDEST> in the C</etc/makepkg.conf> config file.

=back

=head1 PUBLIC METHODS

When using the CPANPLUS module in a perl script to create packages,
these public methods are available.  See the cpanpkgbuild.pl script
included in the examples folder for an example.

=head2 set_destdir

  Usage   : $dist->set_destdir('~/pkg/perl');
  Purpose : Sets the directory to store the resulting package.
  Returns : The directory that was set.

=head2 get_destdir

  Usage   : my $dest = $dist->get_destdir;
  Returns : The directory where the package is going to end up.

=head2 get_pkgvars

  Usage   : my %pkgvars = $dist->get_pkgvars;
  Returns : A hash containing all the PKGBUILD variables.
            Keys are the bash variable names in the PKGBUILD.
            Dependencies are converted to their pacman names.
  
            One new key is 'depshash' whose value is a hashref.
            The hashref keys are packages and values are required versions,
            or 0 if there is no required version.

=head2 get_pkgvars_ref

  Usage    : my $pkgvars_ref = $dist->get_pkgvars_ref;
  Returns  : The same as C<get_pkgvars> except as a hashref.

=head2 get_pkgbuild

  Usage    : my $pkgbuildtext = $dist->get_pkgbuild;
  Returns  : A scalar containing the full text of the PKGBUILD that would
             be generated in the perl pacman package.

=head2 create_pkgbuild

  Usage   : $self->_create_pkgbuild( '/tmp' );
  Purpose : Creates a PKGBUILD file in the specified directory.
  Params  : The directory to put the new PKGBUILD in.
  Precond : You must first call prepare or have CPANPLUS do it automatically.
  Throws  : unknown installer type: '...'
            failed to write PKGBUILD: ...
            Invalid arguments to create_pkgbuild
            Invalid directoy passed to create_pkgbuild: ...
  Returns : Nothing.


=head1 LIMITATIONS

There are some limitations in the way CPANPLUS and pacman works
together that I am not sure can be fixed automatically.  Instead you
might need a human to intervene.  I called these limitations because
they aren't exactly bugs.  More specific bugs with exact error messages
are in the L</BUGS> section.

=item B<Cannot detect non-perl dependencies>

As of version 0.9, CPANPLUS will I<try> to find non-perl dependencies.
This seems to work better with ExtUtils::MakeMaker distributions.
However, this method is far from perfect.

This means if you plan on distributing a perl module package (ie
uploading to AUR) you should edit the PKGBUILD by hand to include
the libraries needed by the XS module.

=item B<A module is installed, but pacman says it isn't>

CPAN[PLUS] considers a module installed if it can be C<use>d.  That
is, if it is in @INC somewhere on your system.

Pacman considers a module installed if it has been packaged and
installed with pacman.

So if you installed some modules in the past without packaging them
first, they don't exist as far as pacman is concerned.  Usually, you
can just reinstall them using this module because CPANPLUS::Dist::Arch
installs modules under the C<vendor_perl/> directories, such as
C</usr/share/perl5/vendor_perl/...>, and CPAN installs under the
C<site_perl/> directories, such as C</usr/share/perl5/site_perl/...>.

Installing with this module will appease C<pacman>, but you may want
to manually delete the previously installed modules to prevent
version mismatch problems.

=item B<Pre-requisites are always installed>

CPANPLUS by default installs the pre-requisite modules before the
module you requested.  This module does the same only it creates an
Arch package and installs it with pacman instead.

You should be able to run pacman under sudo for this to work properly.
Or you could run cpan2dist as root, but I wouldn't recommend it.

=item B<All module packages are installed explicitly>

This has to do with how Pacman categorizes automatically installed
dependencies implicitly installed package.  Explicitly installed
packages are packages installed by the user, by request.

So, logically, all pre-requisite perl modules should be installed
implicitly but right now everything is installed explicitly.

If this is a big problem, tell me and I will try to make some hackish
solution.  I can't think of an elegant way to do this.

=item B<Dist creation of '...' skipped, build time exceeded: 300 seconds>

If compiling a module takes a long time, this message will pop up.
Interestingly, though, the module keeps compiling in the background...?

This is something CPANPLUS does automatically.  If you had been trying
to install the module, the install step will be aborted.  The package
will still be created in the usual directory, so you can install it
manually.

I haven't been able to track this down yet... I think it has only happened
with cpan2dist so far.  It happened when building L<PDL>, by the way.

=head1 TODO

=item * Extract license information from META.yml, maybe use a YAML module.

=head1 SUPPORT

You can find documentation for this module with the perldoc command.

If you are confused why the build process failed, CPANPLUS keeps logs

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

This module was inspired by the perl-cpanplus-pacman package and
CPANPLUS::Dist::Pacman by Firmicus which is available at
L<http://aur.archlinux.org/>.

This mostly started from CPANPLUS::Dist::RPM which is on Google Code
at L<http://code.google.com/p/cpanplus-dist-rpm/>.  This was a very
helpful starting point to try to understand the internals of CPANPLUS.

Notice the helpful variable comments at the beginning of methods?
Stolen!
