This is where I keep all of my notes about CPANPLUS-Dist-Arch and try
to keep track of what I want to do next.

* cpan2aur
** TODO Package Release Incrementing                                   :IDEA:
   I need finer control over incrementing package releases. Sometimes
   I need to force a rebuild of a package. If I don't increment the
   release number and I upload the package, AUR ignores it.
** DONE Possible version sorting bug                                    :BUG:
   A new version sorting algorithm was recently added to cpan2aur.
   I noticed that checking the following packages for a new
   version does not work properly:
   - Devel::GlobalDestruction
   - Class::MOP

   [2011-02-02 Wed] Could not reproduce.
* Makedepends Separation
  I would like to properly filter dependencies into 'makedepends' of
  the packages which are not required to run the perl module. This
  includes things like test scripts.
** DONE perl-class-method-modifiers makedepends                         :BUG:
   Why is perl-text-exception not filtered into makedepends like it
   should be? http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=20124.

   For some reason it had not been uploaded after I generated the
   package with the new rules.
** DONE Read 'build_requires' from META.yml                            :IDEA:
   Since I implemented the use of 'configure_requires' from the
   META.yml I might as well use 'build_requires' as well.
* TODO Multi-line package descriptions aren't read properly             :BUG:
  - perl-debug-showoff :: http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=43824
  - perl-data-taxi :: Seems to have a trailing newline
                      http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=33774
* DONE Convert perl versions                                            :BUG:
  Perl versions listed in requirements of Makefile.PL is in the
  decimal format whereas the 'perl' package versions are given in the
  dotted decimal format.
