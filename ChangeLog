	* lib/CPANPLUS/Dist/Arch.pm (create): Fixed bug where I broke
	skiptest handling when creating the PKGBUILD.
	(create_pkgbuild): Added optional argument for skipping tests in
	PKGBUILD.
	(get_pkgbuild): Same as create_pkgbuild.

2009-12-12  Justin Davis  <jrcd83@gmail.com>

	* 0.14 RELEASE

	* lib/CPANPLUS/Dist/Arch.pm (get_cpandistdir): Fixed bug caused by
	distributions having letters in their filenames.  The extracted
	directory did not have the trailing letter.  Now we use the
	distribution directory name previously stored by CPANPLUS.

	* lib/CPANPLUS/Dist/Arch.pm (dist_pkgver): Fixed bug with letters
	in package versions.  Letters are removed because makepkg cannot
	compare versions with letters properly.  Underscores are now only
	allowed at the end of the version; for developer releases.

	* 0.13 RELEASE

	* lib/CPANPLUS/Dist/Arch.pm (create): Fixed a bug caused when
	PKGDEST environment variable was used.  Fixed a bug when yaourt is
	trying to run ./Build in a /tmp mounted with the noexec option.
	Thanks to "xenoterracide" for pointing this out on the AUR; which
	led me to the even worse PKGDEST bug.

	* lib/CPANPLUS/Dist/Arch.pm (get_pkgpath): Added new method.

	* t/02-build.t: Checks for online connectivity and deletes
	the test package after it is created.

	* ChangeLog: Switched to the emacs style changelog since...
	I use emacs.

Revision history for CPANPLUS-Dist-Arch

0.12    October 29, 2009
        Fixed bugs when searching for XS packages.
        Fixed a regexp bug when escaping bash characters in pkgdesc.
        Changed the automatic perl dependency to not have a version.

0.11    June 9, 2009
        I added List::MoreUtils in the last release, thought it was a
        core module, and forgot to add it to the Build.PL.  So I just
        removed use of "uniq" now.

0.10    May 28, 2009
        Fixed trivial bug with Maintainer in PKGBUILD having a newline.

0.09    May 27, 2009
        Added many package name overrides from the Arch website.
        Removed use of Readonly, now we only need core modules.
        Now searches for non-perl dependencies as well! (ie for XS modules)
        Tweaked PKGBUILD again.

0.08    May 11, 2009
        Added a public method interface to the CPANPLUS::Dist::Arch class.
        Added example script "cpanpkgbuild.pl" and binary script "cpan2aur".
        Changed PKGBUILD template slightly as suggested by smb.

        (I accidentally used the Makefile.PL for this version instead
         of Build.PL!  So META.yml got screwed up.  I also forgot to
         update this file.)

0.07    April 12, 2009
        Fixed the typo bug in last version.  Added a build test so I'll catch this faster.
        Now searches the main module's .pm and .pod files for the pkgdesc as well,
        using Pod::Select.
        Now running as root will work, also useful for nested fakeroot environments...

0.06    April 05, 2009
        Added the setupdistarch script to easily enable/disable CPANPLUS packaging.
        I broke this version with a typo!  Luckily no one suspects anything.

0.05    March 23, 2009
        Inserted missing /CPAN/ text for the PKGBUILD's srcurl variable, 
        Added tests for _translate_name & _translate_version.

0.04    March 22, 2009
        Fixed CPAN version numbers which don't conform to Archlinux standards.
        Stopped using the version module for prefixing everything with v, why!!
        Fixed typos, some inefficient code, etc...

0.03    March 21, 2009
        Included missing file Arch.pod in MANIFEST.
        Fixed some typos in README and Arch.pod.

0.02    March 21, 2009
        Fixed some bugs, separated docs to pod file.
