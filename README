CPANPLUS-Dist-Arch

This module is a wrapper used by CPANPLUS to install perl modules
using the Archlinux pacman package manager.  This makes perl modules
easier to remove, upgrade, etc.

You will need to have pacman installed, of course, to create package
and to install these new packages.  Pacman is included with Archlinux
but can even be used on other Linux distributions.
(see http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman)

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install

CPANPLUS SETUP

This module is not meant to be used directly.  Instead you should use
it through the cpanp shell or the cpan2dist utility that is included
with CPANPLUS.

  $ cpan2dist --format CPANPLUS::Dist::Arch Acme::Bleach

This lengthly command line can be shortened by specifying
CPANPLUS::Dist::Arch as the default 'Dist' type to use in CPANPLUS's
configuration, like so:

  $ cpanp

  ... CPANPLUS's startup output here ...

  CPAN Terminal> s conf dist_type CPANPLUS::Dist::Arch

  Key 'dist_type' was set to 'CPANPLUS::Dist::Arch'
  CPAN Terminal> s save

  Configuration successfully saved to CPANPLUS::Config::User
      (/home/<yournamehere>/.cpanplus/lib/CPANPLUS/Config/User.pm)
  CPAN Terminal> q

  Exiting CPANPLUS shell

Now you do not have to use the explicit --format flag:

  $ cpan2dist Acme::Bleach

After dist_type is set, CPANPLUS will automatically package
anything you install using cpanp.  Score!  You could then package
and install the Acme::Bleach module like so:

  $ cpanp i Acme::Bleach

WHERES IS THE PACKAGE?

Packages are stored under the user's home directory, (the HOME
environment variable) under the .cpanplus directory.  Two seperate
directories are created for building packages and for storing the
resulting package file.

Build Directory   : ~/.cpanplus/5.10.0/pacman/build
Package Directory : ~/.cpanplus/5.10.0/pacman/pkg


Where 5.10.0 represents the version of perl you used to build the
package and ~/.cpanplus represents the base directory chosen
in your CPANPLUS config.

You can change the destination by setting PKGDEST in your
/etc/makepkg.conf file.  The PACKAGER in /etc/makepkg.conf is
inserted into the PKGBUILD comment header.  If there is no PACKAGER
set, then 'Anonymous' is used, instead.
