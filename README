CPANPLUS-Dist-Arch

This module is a wrapper used by CPANPLUS to install perl modules
using the Archlinux pacman package manager.  This makes perl modules
easier to remove, upgrade, etc.

You will need to have pacman installed, of course, to create package
and to install these new packages.  Pacman is included with Archlinux
but can even be used on other Linux distributions.
(see http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman)
