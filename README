NAME
    CPANPLUS::Dist::Arch - CPANPLUS backend for building Archlinux pacman
    packages

VERSION
    Version 0.17

SYNOPSIS
      (First, setup cpan to use us automatically)
      $ setupdistarch

      (Install the module as a pacman package)
      $ cpanp -i Perl::Module::Here

      (Use cpan2dist to make a package, but don't install it)
      $ cpan2dist Acme::Bleach

      (Use our included cpan2aur to make a source package in current dir)
      $ cpan2aur CPANPLUS::Dist::Arch

      (In case we need to customize our package build, create a directory
       with a template we can use for future versions.)
      $ cpan2aur -d CPANPLUS::Dist::Arch
      ==> Creating new directory for CPANPLUS::Dist::Arch...
        -> Looking up module for CPANPLUS::Dist::Arch on CPAN...
      Running [/usr/bin/perl /usr/bin/perlbin/core/cpanp-run-perl /home/juster/.cpanplus/5.10.1/build/CPANPLUS-Dist-Arch-0.16/Makefile.PL INSTALLDIRS=site]...
      Writing Makefile for CPANPLUS::Dist::Arch
        -> Creating new PKGBUILD.tt template file...
      ==> Created perl-cpanplus-dist-arch source package directory.

      (Customize the template... add a optdepends, library depends, etc.
       Just leave the rest of it alone.)
      $ cd perl-cpanplus-dist-arch
      $ ed PKGBUILD.tt

      (Submit it to AUR!  Will ask for a login username/password or remember
       the last one used)
      $ cpan2aur -u

DESCRIPTION
    This module is used as a plugin of CPANPLUS to transparently package
    CPAN distribution files into pacman packages as they are installed. This
    module can also be used by programmers to build packages in more complex
    ways. For example, it can create source packages for the AUR by using
    the included cpan2aur program.

REQUIREMENTS
    You will need to have pacman installed, of course, to create package and
    to install these new packages. Pacman is included with Archlinux but can
    even be used on other Linux distributions. (see
    http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman)

SETUP
    Type setupdistarch at the command line to install CPAN modules as
    packages by default.

WHERE IS THE PACKAGE
    By default, packages are stored under the user's home directory in the
    .cpanplus directory. Two seperate directories are created for building
    packages and for storing the resulting package file.

    *5.10.1* represents the version of perl you used to build the package
    and *~/.cpanplus* represents the base directory chosen in your CPANPLUS
    config.

    Build Directory - `~/.cpanplus/5.10.1/pacman/build'
    Package Directory - `~/.cpanplus/5.10.1/pacman/pkg'

CUSTOMIZATION
    You can change defaults settings machine-wide (for every user) or for
    one user or package. The machine-wide settings are set in the
    */etc/makepkg.conf* file. The user/package customizations are set using
    environment variables.

    PKGDEST - Override where the package files end up.
    PACKAGER - Override the Contributor comment line at the top of the
    PKGBUILD.

SUPPORT
    Email me at `juster at cpan dot org' or message me as *juster* on the
    Archlinux BBS at http://bbs.archlinux.org.

    To check why the build process failed, read the build logs CPANPLUS
    keeps in `~/.cpanplus/install_logs/'. The problem may be specific to the
    module you're building and not this module.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    This module was inspired by the perl-cpanplus-pacman package and
    CPANPLUS::Dist::Pacman by Firmicus which is available at
    http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=5954.

    This mostly started from CPANPLUS::Dist::RPM which is on Google Code at
    http://code.google.com/p/cpanplus-dist-rpm/. This was a very helpful
    starting point to try to understand the internals of CPANPLUS.
