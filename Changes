Revision history for CPANPLUS-Dist-Arch

0.07    April 12, 2009
        Fixed the typo bug in last version.  Added a build test so I'll catch this faster.
        Now searches the main module's .pm and .pod files for the pkgdesc as well,
        using Pod::Select.
        Now running as root will work, also useful for nested fakeroot environments...
